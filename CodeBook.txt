The script named "run_analysis.R" is the only one needed. It is highly commented and self-explanatory, however here is a detailed overview of what it does, step by step (square brackets "[]" are used here to denote variables, vectors, data frames, etc. used in the script):
1.	Reads the names of all features from features.txt into [feature_names_original].
2.	Identifies the indices for "mean" [mean_indices] and "std" [std_indices] features only, and keeps them sorted in [indices], together with their respective descriptions.
3.	Separates [indices] into [feature_indices] and [feature_names], to be later used as column names.
4.	Tides up these variable names:
1.	Changes "-" to "_"
2.	Deals with duplicate "Body" in "BodyBody"
5.	Reads the activity labels into [activity_labels].
6.	Reads the training and the test sets, and processes both of them in the same manner:
1.	Takes only selected columns, as per [feature_indices], and stores data in [X_train / X_test].
2.	Assigns feature names to data.
3.	Reads training subject IDs into [X_tr_subject / X_ts_subject].
4.	Assigns a column name "subject" instead of "V1".
5.	Reads the training activity index into [y_train_ind / y_test_ind].
6.	Assigns a column name "activity_index" instead of "V1".
7.	Merges (by binding columns) the subject IDs + activity ind + measurements into [X_tr_temp / X_ts_temp].
8.	Merges (by joining) in order to get activity descriptions (in addition ti IDs) into [X_tr_description / X_ts_description].
9.	Creates tidy training / test sets into [X_tr / X_ts].
?	subject ID first
?	activity descriptions second
?	then all the mean / std measurements
7.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set [X].
8.	From the data set [X], it creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. It is called [agg_wide], as it shows an aggregation in the wide (rather than long) format.
9.	Makes sure that [agg_wide] is tidy and self-explanatory:
1.	First columns, by which aggregation is done, are named properly ("activity_description" and "subject" respectively).
2.	All subsequent mean variables are prefixed with "mean_of_".
3.	Rows are sorted by activity_description and subject.
10.	Creates a file named "averages_wide_format.txt" from [agg_wide]. This data set can be found in this repo.
